Taxes are due for purchases from those residing in California.\r\n\r\nWe accept both PAYPAL and DIRECT CHECK OUT via Etsy. \r\n\r\nPaypal allows for payment via Paypal account, credit/debit card or via echeck (echeck takes about a week to clear). If paying by e-check product will not be made or shipped until e-check has cleared. \r\n\r\nDirect check-out via Etsy allows for credit/debit cards directly without any Paypal involvement. \r\n",
"policy_shipping": "DOMESTIC SHIPPING: We ship USPS Priority and it includes online tracking, I will send you the tracking number once shipped. \r\n\r\nIf you want to upgrade your domestic order to Express mail, PLEASE see listing in my shop marked &quot;Express Shipping&quot; or contact us BEFORE placing your order.\r\n\r\nLarge orders are shipped UPS and require a signature when delivered.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: Shipping to all other countries will be shipped USPS First Class with no tracking number available. Once items leave the US they are no longer the shop&#39;s responsibility. Customs in your country may charge a fee and will be buyer’s responsibility and will not be paid by Southern Girl Apparel. Please check on your country&#39;s customs rates before purchase.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that for international shipments, there may be unexpected delays if your package is held at customs. We have no control over shipments after they leave our hands. Buyers are responsible for any import duties imposed by their country of residence. All orders shipped internationally through Etsy include the full purchase price on the customs form.\r\n\r\nSTOLEN AFTER DELIVERY or UNDELIVERABLE DUE TO SHIPPING ADDRESS PROVIDED ON ETSY: Refunds or replacements will *not* be issued for merchandise that has been &quot;delivered&quot; to your requested address, according to the USPS tracking number, but you claim you never received it. I am not responsible for your stolen mail, and will not provide a replacement at my expense or a refund for your missing goods. You can request a signature confirmation at delivery for an additional $2.20 USD. Also, partial refunds (minus original shipping) are issued when an order is returned to me because a delivery attempt was made and a notice was left, but the buyer did not pick up the package or arrange a re-delivery for whatever reason, or an incorrect address was provided by the buyer on Etsy. If you choose to have me re-ship the product back to you, it will be AT YOUR EXPENSE -- no exceptions. \r\n\r\n*PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE check your ADDRESS in ETSY prior to purchasing. I ship your purchase to your Etsy address. Sometimes, Etsy will try to add a &quot;Street&quot;, &quot;Terr&quot; or &quot;Drive&quot; to your address. I DO NOT alter your shipping address. Please understand there may be a shipping delay if you do not include the full address as USPS considers this an &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; shipping address. If you realize your address is incorrect after purchase, please convo me ASAP to avoid a delay in shipping and/or not receiving your purchase* \r\n\r\nORDERS LOST IN TRANSIT: In the event that a US order is *lost in transit* by the US Postal Service and has not arrived in 45 days, as verified by the tracking information, you will be offered a refund minus the original shipping charges. I am not responsible for orders listed as &#39;delivered&#39; that are stolen after delivery (see details above). If your international order has not arrived in 45 days, it is likely lost or stolen. I am not responsible for lost or stolen international orders where I can guarantee the box was shipped by providing you with a shipping receipt on paper. Unfortunately, tracking numbers are only available for international orders where expensive priority international mail is used, which I do not offer, as it is always more expensive than the cost of my goods.\r\n",
"policy_refunds": "We do want you to be perfectly happy with your purchase but if for some reason you are not I do allow a one time exchange on most items, just send it back to me, be sure to include a note of what size you want. And we will accept returns within 7 days. However, the customer will be responsible for shipping costs; we will ONLY refund the purchase price. If a refund is requested on a listing with free shipping, the shipping costs will be subtracted before refund is submitted.\r\n\r\nALL ITEMS RETURNED MUST BE IN NEW, UNUSED AND UNLAUNDERED CONDITION. WE ONLY RETURN ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED DIRECTLY FROM ETSY/SOUTHERNGIRLAPPAREL.COM. All ITEMS MUST HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL TAGS ATTACHED. \r\n\r\nIf you receive an item that is damaged send a note and a photo and we&#39;ll start working with you right away to exchange or refund your purchase. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m sorry I do not accept returns on holiday items, 4th of July, Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Thanksgiving, etc...\r\nI put the measurements and do my best to describe the item in the &quot;Item Details&quot; area so be sure to check them before ordering.",

CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: MY ORDER ARRIVED BROKE, ENGRAVED WRONG, ETC.

"policy_additional": "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  \r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\n*Expedited orders, large orders or orders with not stock in the USA will come from our Hong Kong shop. We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave / print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n",

"policy_welcome": "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",

"policy_additional": "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  \r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\n*Expedited orders, large orders or orders with not stock in the USA will come from our Hong Kong shop. We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave / print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n",

If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: MY ORDER ARRIVED BROKE, ENGRAVED WRONG, ETC. WHAT&#39;S NEXT?\r\n\r\nreply: you see, we always and without question replace broken, incorrectly engraved items, free of charge, so please don&#39;t worry. just email us, let us know exactly what needs to be replaced along with a few supporting images (if convenient). typically speaking, lead-time for replacements are the same as the original order. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nQUESTION: I FORGOT TO LEAVE PERSONALIZATION DETAILS \r\n\r\nreply: you see, just send those details to the email address above with order # in subject line. we do not ship blank, non-personalized items. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nQUESTION: I NEED TO CHANGE MY SHIPPING ADDRESS \r\n\r\nreply: you see, as long as the order hasn&#39;t shipped, we can change the shipping address. simply email the shipping address with order # in subject line. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your business. \r\n\r\nTeals Prairie & Co.\r\nsupport@tealsprairieco.zendesk.com",

"policy_additional": "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  \r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\n*Expedited orders, large orders or orders with not stock in the USA will come from our Hong Kong shop. We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave / print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n",

Rush shipping can be selected during checkout.

We are capable of creating just about any design you can imagine so just let us know what you are wanting and we’d be happy to provide a quote. Our minimum art fee is $35 for something basic or all text and goes up from there based on intricacy and time estimated to complete your artwork. Requires purchase of custom barrel, art fee and a custom listing since cost will vary based on design desired.\n\n\n✪FINISH AND HOOP OPTIONS:\n-Unfinished/Steel: Unfinished Barrel with Steel Hoops\n-Finished/Steel: Finished barrel with Steel Hoops\n-Unfinished/Black: Unfinished Barrel with Black Hoops\n-Finished/Black: Finished barrel with Black Hoops\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE? Finished barrels will have a few light coats of a clear, water based finish applied to them.  Unfinished barrel will not have this finish applied.  Steel hoops are steel.  Black hoops are steel hoops coated in black.\n\n✪ RUSH PRODUCTION & RUSH SHIPPING OPTIONS: To be fair to all customers, we offer standard and rush options to all customers. Unless rush production has been ordered, all orders are produced in the order in which they are received to be fair to all customers. Upgrading shipping will expedite your shipping. Adding a rush production will place your order into the rush production queue ahead of the line. You can select one or both options based on what you need and one is not required to purchase the other. Requesting rush options in the note to seller area will not expedite your order unless you have added a rush to your order. We had to implement this policy to be fair to all customers since 85% of customers ordering have a specific date in mind that they&#39;d like their order. All current production times, order cutoff dates, etc. are all posted in the shop banner. \n\n✪ BARREL DIMENSIONS:\n1 Liter 6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches\n2 Liter 7.5 x 5 x 5 inches\n3 Liter 8.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches\n5 Liter 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 inches\n10 Liter 12 x 8 x 8 inches\n20 Liter 15 x 10.5 x 10.5 inches\n*DIMESIONS ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE STAND HEIGHT AND WIDTH. If needing to fit within a specific space, please contact us and we can provide measurements including the stand. Although it doesn&#39;t seem like there is a great difference in sizes, a 1 liter will hold an entire liter more and so on. Larger barrels also come with larger stands to ensure everything looks proportionate.\n\n✪FREE SHIPPING PROMOTION:\nFree Standard Domestic Shipping within the Continental USA only. Excludes orders shipping to AK, HI, PR or internationally, as shipping is higher to ship to these locations. Excludes all expedited options. We reserve the right to ship the most economical way, (most often USPS 1st class) and therefore cannot guarantee a specific delivery date. If ordering multiple items, we may split your order into multiple shipments to reduce shipping costs. \n\n✪ ENGRAVING INFO:\nEach design will state what lines can be personalized free. Copy and paste personalization lines and enter your personalization in note to seller area. If you selected personalized and did not enter personalization- no worries, you will be contacted to get the needed info prior to shipping your order :) If you ordered a blank barrel, but entered personalization, your barrel will arrive blank-you will only get a personalized barrel if you ordered a personalized barrel. Please be sure to enter all personalization exactly as you want it engraved. Note that some fonts used in certain designs do not always have both upper and lower case characters. In this case all letters will be uppercase regardless of how it is entered since this is all the font allows. Please refer to the images in each listing for reference. \n\n✪ INTERNATIONAL ORDERS:\nWe ship to most destinations worldwide! Please be aware that if we are unable to ship to your location, we will notify you, cancel your order and refund you in full. Shipping calculation errors may occur with international shipping on Etsy that are out of our control and we accept no responsibility for these errors. If ordering multiple items, we reserve the right to ship in multiple packages to reduce shipping costs. We reserve the right to use other carriers other than USPS if it is more cost effective and the lowest shipping shown is always for the most economical shipping option available regardless of what method is stated during checkout. In the event shipping is much higher than shown we will contact you and offer to invoice for the difference or cancel your order. If you decide to cancel, we will issue you a full refund. We want to continue to offer international shipping, so thank you for your understanding.\n\nPlease be sure we have all information needed to create your one of a kind barrel. If we do not receive all necessary information to create your custom barrel, your order will be placed on hold so we can contact you. Please be sure to include all info~ we really want you to love your custom barrel!  \n\n☎ Have Questions or need help creating your customized barrel?  There&#39;s a lot of options, so please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to assist you.\n\nThank you for your business!  We appreciate each and every one of you :)\n\nCSP_5",

Each listing clearly states what customization can be made (if any). By customer request, the option to order blank barrels are now on every listing so it is easier to find. To order a completely blank barrel, simply select &quot;blank barrel&quot;. Since most personalized designs are just templates and will be engraved as shown, but with your personalization copied/pasted into the template, we do not provide proofs on these designs. We only include proofs on full custom artwork orders (additional cost). This helps to keep turnaround times as quick as possible.\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\nCHANGES & CANCELLATIONS:\r\nOnce an order is received, a shipping label is created and your order is pre-labeled and entered into the production queue. Since it can be rather difficult to track down an order already in production, we ask that you please double check all information you are submitting for accuracy prior to submitting, (including personalization, shipping address, sizing, etc.). Our listings are very detailed, so generally provide quite a bit of info within the listing as well in regards to what is needed. This helps to eliminate confusion and mistakes from being made. Due to these reasons and due to many changes being requested, especially around holidays, we had to implement a no change- no cancellation policy and cannot make exceptions. If you need to make a change to the shipping address or personalization please contact us IMMEDIATELY. We can in no way guarantee the change will be made, but will make every effort to change your order for you.  Once a label has been purhcased and printed, we will not make changes to the shipping address.  In the event a cancellation is honored, there will be a $35 cancellation fee assessed. By requesting cancellation, you are agreeing to this charge. You can view our cancellation and change request policy on our policy page for more info.\r\n\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\n✪SUBSTITUTIONS:\r\nPlease note that in very rare circumstances (usually around Christmas), we may, at our discretion, substitute for a different hoop color if the wait time for the color you ordered exceeds one week.  This is very rare, but can happen and is something that every barrel company has to deal with from time to time and therefore, this will not warrant a refund or replacement as this cannot be helped. \r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\n☎ Please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

However, during peak times this can increase, especially during the Holidays, After DEC 10, all orders will require rush production and rush shipping in order to be received by Christmas.\r\n\r\nRush Production expedites the production process and does not include any rush shipping upgrades. If you need rush shipping, please select appropriate option during checkout. \r\n\r\nPlease do not enter requests for rush production or rush shipping in the note to seller area during checkout, as this will not expedite your order- it may delay it.  This is because all orders received are first entered into the system. Then a shipping label and a sheet detailing your personalization is printed and placed in the box. That box is then sent down the production line to be produced crossing multiple stations before finally making its way to be packed and placed in carrier pickup.  If there is notes requesting rush services but no order for those services, your order is pulled and highlighted with &quot;Contact Customer 1st&quot; and can only be entered into the system once you have purchased the requested upgrades and we have finalized your order. \r\n\r\n✦✦✦✦✦✦ RETURNED PACKAGES: ✦✦✦✦✦✦\r\nPlease be sure to check your address for accuracy PRIOR to submitting your order.

"policy_refunds": "Since each item is made to order, like many of our products, we have a no return and no refund policy.  If there is damage during shipping, please alert us and contact the shipping carrier to file your claim.  If we have made an error on your barrel, please send a high quality photo to steve.barrels@customsentiments.com and be sure to reference your Etsy order number in the subject line, describing the issue.  We will review your order and if warranted, offer a free replacement.  We will then send a RMA label for the return of your defective barrel.  The return of the defective barrel is required prior to processing any free exchange.  Once received, we will send you a replacement.  All replacement&#39;s are for the same exact item only, with the same exact personalization, finish, etc. and no changes can be made to your order.\r\n\r\nORDER CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS:\r\nPlease contact us immediately if you need to make a change to your order.  We will do our best to accomodate, but we can in no way guarantee that a change can be made.  It is important to note that once an order is received, it is pre-labeled for shipping with a note regarding personalizations and sent down the production line through several stations.  It can take hours to locate where an order is in the process, which is why we cannot accept any change requests once an order enters the production queue.  Since each item is made to order, we do not allow cancellations.  Once an order has been placed, we will not honor cancellation requests, so please make sure you want to order our products prior to placing your order.Please be sure you are ordering exactly what you want and double check all personalization entered prior to placing an order.  In the event we agree to cancel an order, there is a $35 cancellation fee assessed and you will be refunded the price paid less the cancellation fee.  This is only allowed in rare circumstances and only if the order has not entered the production queue and is not something we do often.  There is absolutely no cancellations for any custom barrel designs (artwork) as we start the design process shortly after receiving the order or for orders that are in the production queue-no exceptions. By placing your order with us, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the Holidays, all orders are pre-labeled as they enter the production queue to keep the queue clean, prevent duplicates from being shipped and to keep everything running efficiently. Once you place an order and your order is processed we will purchase a shipping label. When we purchase your label Etsy will automatically send you a shipping notification. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR ORDER SHIPPED, ONLY THAT WE PURCHASED A LABEL AND YOUR ORDER IS IN THE PRODUCTION QUEUE. Your tracking link provided will not become active until your order has been completed and picked up by the carrier. During the Holiday season we have to stick with a no change and no cancellation policy once an order has been pre-labeled and we will not make any exceptions, as this helps prevent any delays, duplicates or confusion with orders. Please be sure to check your order for accuracy prior to submitting, as we will not be able to make changes to your shipping address, your personalization, cancel an order or make any additional changes once your order has been pre-labeled and enters the production queue. \r\n\r\nPricing is subject to change without notice. We on occasion offer sales, free shipping offers, coupon codes and freebies. As with any website, a sale can be here today and gone tomorrow. If you place an order today and a sale starts tomorrow, this does not constitute a refund, just as if you were placing an order today and the price went up tomorrow we would not expect the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease note that in very rare circumstances (usually around Christmas), we may, at our discretion, substitute for a different hoop color if the wait time for the color you ordered exceeds one week.  This is very rare, but can happen and is something that every barrel company has to deal with from time to time and therefore, this will not warrant a refund or replacement as this cannot be helped. \r\n\r\nPROBLEMS WITH YOUR ORDER?\r\nPlease email order support at support@customsentiments.com, being sure to reference your Etsy Order number in the subject line of the email. A few good quality photos are required to open an exchange request. Due to the custom nature of our products, we do not offer refunds since once personalized it cannot simply be returned to stock. Please note that since wood is a natural product and not man made, there will be variations in color of wood from barrel to barrel and it may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos.  This is something that cannot be controlled for any wood product, not just barrels. Barrels are engraved using a laser and are not printed.  All true barrels will have a rivet from manufacturing- some more prominent than others no matter where ordered.   We just like to be more up front than most so you know what to expect.  Also note that the barrel rings may have a few &quot;scars&quot;, which is again perfectly normal no matter where you order a true barrel from.  The mentioned do not warrant an exchange.  Just enjoy your unique one of a kind barrel for the unique work of art it truly is and it&#39;ll love you back ;)  \r\n\r\nABANDONED ORDERS: We cannot process an order that is incomplete, not correctly entered or where additional shipping may be due due to request for upgrades in which your order will be on hold until payment has been received for the upgrade.  In the event we have questions regarding your order we will attempt to make contact with you.  If we have made reasonable effort to contact you regarding your order and we have not received a response within 60 days we will, at our discretion, treat your order as an abandoned order.  No refunds will be given and no cancellation requests accepted after 60 days from date of your order.  Since all orders need to be closed out within the Etsy system, a blank shipping notification will be sent out to close your order out after the initial 60 days wait time. \r\n\r\nNOTE: All information is given as an estimated time table and not a guaranteed date of service. We cannot be held liable for missing or incorrectly entered information or addresses entered by the customer, inclement weather or other service interruptions that cause missing, late or undelivered packages or other service interruptions that are out of our control. However, we are happy to assist and direct you the best we can should any shipping issue arise. Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be responsible for carrier delays due to inclement weather or other issues out of our control. No refunds will be given (even for rush services), when these issues arise as we cannot prevent them, nor control them. We are not responsible for a package once it is in the carriers hands and it is up to the carrier to deliver the package once shipped. Please contact the carrier for any shipping related issues- a tracking number is provided on all orders for your convenience. We are happy to assist you in contacting the carrier when needed to resolve delivery issues within 7 days of delivery date.",
"policy_additional": "DESIGN PROOFS: \r\nWe get asked for design proofs A LOT.  We do not provide design proofs or photos for personalized orders using current designs.  ONLY FULLY CUSTOM designs or large corporate logo orders can request a design proof.  Proofing may be subject to a $25 proof charge so please request a custom listing if you would like to add a design proof.  Your proof includes one small revision if necessary, as well as one revised proof.  Proofs are not photographs of the actual barrel. This will be a design proof.  \r\n\r\nCan I use my OWN PHOTO OR LOGO? \r\nYes, absolutely!  We do have a few rules on this though:\r\n1) Your image must be complete and ready to engrave, meaning:\r\n  a. It must be high quality (300 dpi at product size or vector)\r\n  b. It must be 100% black and white (black is what gets engraved).\r\n  c. It cannot violate any copyright or trademarks.\r\n  d. It must be complete with all text, imagery, etc. and not need any editing on our part.  If any changes, modifications, additions or other editing is needed, there may be additional cost for this service.\r\n  \r\n2) We DO NOT accept artwork that violates any copyright or trademark.

We are unable to change this and unfortunately cannot help this from happening as it is an issue in the Etsy system itself.  If your order shows it will ship on one of the above dates that we are closed, it will be shipped on the next business day.  If your order is placed outside of business hours or on a weekend or Holiday, it will be entered the next business day.

ANSWER: \r\nSteel Hoops are made of steel.\r\nBlack hoops are powder coated steel hoops.\r\nFinished will have a few light sprays of clear coat on it.\r\nUnfinished is simply unfinished- no clear coat\r\n✪No heavy stains, dyes or varnishes are used on these barrels so it will not affect the integrity of the barrel. Finished vs. unfinished is purely an aesthetics preference. Please note that since wood is a natural product it may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos.  Photos are of an actual barrel with designs superimposed onto the barrel. Barrels ate not printed, they are engraved using a laser burner.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How are these made?\r\nANSWER: These are made using a laser burner, as most custom distillery grade barrels are.  It is completely normal to have darker areas around the engraved portion of your barrel caused by the laser.  This is not smudging and is meant to give your barrel it&#39;s character. Some barrels will have more than others, but that is what makes each barrel unique and no two barrels alike.  Please love and respect your custom barrels for the unique pieces of art they are and they will love you back ;)  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: What are the barrels made from?\r\nANSWER: Our barrels are made from premium quality American White Oak. The staves are air dried for two years and all barrels have a medium char.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I cure the barrel?\r\nANSWER: Barrels should be cured prior to use. Start by filling the barrel with boiling or hot water and leave it to soak for 3 to 5 days. This allows the barrel to swell tightly against the hoops and ensure that the barrel doesn&#39;t leak.  Your barrel WILL leak if you have not cured it.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Are glues or nails used to make the barrel?\r\nANSWER: No, our barrels are all hand crafted with no use of glues or nails.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How should the barrel be stored?\r\nANSWER: Barrels are best stored in a cool damp environment such as a wine cellar. This will keep the exterior from drying out and minimize evaporation (Angels Share).  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: How many times can I use my barrel?\r\nANSWER: These are high grade barrels!  With proper care, you can use your barrel for 8 to 10 years. Following the cleaning and re-charing instructions will insure a long life for your product and be sure to not let your barrel dry out.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: I left my barrel dry for an extented time. Now it leaks... what do I do?\r\nANSWER: In many cases just re-cure the barrel. If it continues leaking, submerge the barrel in water for a couple of days. After it&#39;s been submerged, dry the exterior with a towel and fill it with water to see if it continues to leak. If so, find the leak and apply barrel wax to the hole... If you can&#39;t stop the leaking... cut in half and use as a planter!\r\n\r\nQUESTION: My barrel is rough around the edges and does not look exactly like pictured.  Is this a defect?  \r\nANSWER: No, these are made with natural wood and therefore there will always be variation in color, roughness, veining, etc.  This does not affect the functionality of your barrel and is not a defect.  This is something that every barrel company has to deal with and cannot be helped regardless of where you order from.  We just like to be more upfront about it.  In the barrel world, the uniqueness of each barrel is also what we consider it&#39;s character.  Although similar, no two barrels will ever be alike and that is what gives the barrels their character and what lends to the beauty and uniqueness of each barrel.  We suggest loving your barrel for the truly unique piece of art and it will love you back ;)\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ CLEANING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How often do I clean my barrel?\r\nANSWER: When aging hard spirits such as whiskey, rum or tequila, clean the barrel after two or three batches (or every 1 to 2 years). For wine, cider, liquor or other low alcohol content spirits, clean after each batch.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I clean  my barrel?\r\nMULTI- STEP ANSWER:\r\n1.Dissolve the Cleaning Solution into warm water (we sell a cleaning kit for this). Fill the barrel with this cleaning solution and soak for 24 hours. Empty and rinse 3 times with hot water.\r\n2.Dissolve the Neutralizing Acid into warm water. Fill the barrel with this neutralizing solution and soak for 15 minutes. Empty and rinse the barrel 3 times with hot water.\r\n3.To re-char the barrel interior, drain the barrel for 3 hours. Place a butane torch in the bung and spigot hole and re-char the inside.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: To prevent the barrel from drying out and minimize the possibility of contamination, barrels should always be stored full with spirits or water with sterilizing solution.\r\n\r\n***See cleaning package directions for exact mixture quantities.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ STORING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I store my barrel?\r\nANSWER: When storing the barrel fill the barrel with a mixture of sterilizing tablets and cool water. Fill the barrel with the solution and leave in a cool damp place until you are ready to use again.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ AGING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How long do I age my spirits?\r\nANSWER: There&#39;s no formula for the perfect time to age your spirits. Age to taste! We suggest you taste your spirits every week and once aged to YOUR taste, start drinking or move it to a glass bottle to stop the aging process.  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do smaller barrels age the spirit faster than large barrels?\r\nANSWER: Yes... due to the greater surface or contact area ratio, small size barrels will age 5 to 10 times faster then your standard 55 gallon barrel. These means that one month in a small barrel will produce the equivalent aging to 1 to 1 1/2 years in a full size barrel.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ BOOTLEGGIN&#39; ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I get Whiskey from a bottle of Vodka, Swish or Moonshine?\r\nANSWER: When alcohol is distilled, either from potatoes, corn, fruit, grain or sugar cane, it produces Ethanol. A clear and tasteless alcohol. Distilleries then flavor and filter the alcohol to get their unique flavor. Vodka is the only alcohol you can buy in an unflavored form. When mixed with a bottle of  Barrel Premium Essence, you can recreate the taste of many of the famous brands.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Will a more expensive Vodka produce a better tasting whiskey?\r\nANSWER: No!  We actually recommend using a cheaper Vodka such as Taaka or the like, as it will pick up the flavors better and thus have a better taste.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do you sell Bootleg kits?  \r\nANSWER: Yes, we do!  Simply contact us and we would be happy to assist you.\r\n",

We do not make monogram assumptions, so please be sure to enter ONLY INITIALS for this option&#39;s personalization in the order you want.\n\n✪FINISH AND HOOP OPTIONS:\n-Unfinished/Steel: Unfinished Barrel with Steel Hoops\n-Finished/Steel: Finished barrel with Steel Hoops\n-Unfinished/Black: Unfinished Barrel with Black Hoops\n-Finished/Black: Finished barrel with Black Hoops\n-Unfinished/Brass: Unfinished Barrel with Brass Hoops\n-Finished/Brass: Finished Barrel with Brass Hoops\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE? Finished barrels will have a few light coats of a clear, water based finish applied to them. Unfinished barrel will not have this finish applied. Steel hoops are steel. Black hoops are steel hoops coated in black.\n\n✪ RUSH PRODUCTION & RUSH SHIPPING OPTIONS: To be fair to all customers, we offer standard and rush options to all customers. Unless rush production has been ordered, all orders are produced in the order in which they are received to be fair to all customers. Upgrading shipping will expedite your shipping. Adding a rush production will place your order into the rush production queue ahead of the line. You can select one or both options based on what you need and one is not required to purchase the other. Requesting rush options in the note to seller area will not expedite your order unless you have added a rush to your order. We had to implement this policy to be fair to all customers since 85% of customers ordering have a specific date in mind that they&#39;d like their order. All current production times, order cutoff dates, etc. are all posted in the shop banner. \n\n✪ BARREL DIMENSIONS:\n1 Liter 6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches \n2 Liter 7.5 x 5 x 5 inches  \n3 Liter 8.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches  *This listing is for a 3 liter barrel.\n5 Liter 9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 inches \n10 Liter 12 x 8 x 8 inches\n20 Liter 15 x 10.5 x 10.5 inches\n*DIMESIONS ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE STAND HEIGHT AND WIDTH. If needing to fit within a specific space, please contact us and we can provide measurements including the stand. Although it doesn&#39;t seem like there is a great difference in sizes, a 1 liter will hold an entire liter more and so on. Larger barrels also come with larger stands to ensure everything looks proportionate.\n\n✪FREE SHIPPING PROMOTION:\nFree Standard Domestic Shipping within the Continental USA only. Excludes orders shipping to AK, HI, PR or internationally, as shipping is higher to ship to these locations. Excludes all expedited options. We reserve the right to ship the most economical way, (most often USPS 1st class) and therefore cannot guarantee a specific delivery date. If ordering multiple items, we may split your order into multiple shipments to reduce shipping costs. \n\n✪ ENGRAVING INFO:\nWhen submitting your own design, please make sure your design is complete with all text and/or imagery present. Remember what you submit IS what gets engraved.\n\n✪ INTERNATIONAL ORDERS:\nWe ship to most destinations worldwide! Please be aware that if we are unable to ship to your location, we will notify you, cancel your order and refund you in full. Shipping calculation errors may occur with international shipping on Etsy that are out of our control and we accept no responsibility for these errors. If ordering multiple items, we reserve the right to ship in multiple packages to reduce shipping costs. We reserve the right to use other carriers other than USPS if it is more cost effective and the lowest shipping shown is always for the most economical shipping option available regardless of what method is stated during checkout. In the event shipping is much higher than shown we will contact you and offer to invoice for the difference or cancel your order. If you decide to cancel, we will issue you a full refund. We want to continue to offer international shipping, so thank you for your understanding.\n\nPlease be sure we have all information needed to create your one of a kind barrel.

Each listing clearly states what customization can be made (if any). By customer request, the option to order blank barrels are now on every listing so it is easier to find. To order a completely blank barrel, simply select &quot;blank barrel&quot;. Since most personalized designs are just templates and will be engraved as shown, but with your personalization copied/pasted into the template, we do not provide proofs on these designs. We only include proofs on full custom artwork orders (additional cost). This helps to keep turnaround times as quick as possible.\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\nCHANGES & CANCELLATIONS:\r\nOnce an order is received, a shipping label is created and your order is pre-labeled and entered into the production queue. Since it can be rather difficult to track down an order already in production, we ask that you please double check all information you are submitting for accuracy prior to submitting, (including personalization, shipping address, sizing, etc.). Our listings are very detailed, so generally provide quite a bit of info within the listing as well in regards to what is needed. This helps to eliminate confusion and mistakes from being made. Due to these reasons and due to many changes being requested, especially around holidays, we had to implement a no change- no cancellation policy and cannot make exceptions. If you need to make a change to the shipping address or personalization please contact us IMMEDIATELY. We can in no way guarantee the change will be made, but will make every effort to change your order for you.  Once a label has been purhcased and printed, we will not make changes to the shipping address.  In the event a cancellation is honored, there will be a $35 cancellation fee assessed. By requesting cancellation, you are agreeing to this charge. You can view our cancellation and change request policy on our policy page for more info.\r\n\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\n✪SUBSTITUTIONS:\r\nPlease note that in very rare circumstances (usually around Christmas), we may, at our discretion, substitute for a different hoop color if the wait time for the color you ordered exceeds one week.  This is very rare, but can happen and is something that every barrel company has to deal with from time to time and therefore, this will not warrant a refund or replacement as this cannot be helped. \r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n\r\n☎ Please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to assist you.

However, during peak times this can increase, especially during the Holidays, After DEC 10, all orders will require rush production and rush shipping in order to be received by Christmas.\r\n\r\nRush Production expedites the production process and does not include any rush shipping upgrades. If you need rush shipping, please select appropriate option during checkout. \r\n\r\nPlease do not enter requests for rush production or rush shipping in the note to seller area during checkout, as this will not expedite your order- it may delay it.  This is because all orders received are first entered into the system. Then a shipping label and a sheet detailing your personalization is printed and placed in the box. That box is then sent down the production line to be produced crossing multiple stations before finally making its way to be packed and placed in carrier pickup.  If there is notes requesting rush services but no order for those services, your order is pulled and highlighted with &quot;Contact Customer 1st&quot; and can only be entered into the system once you have purchased the requested upgrades and we have finalized your order. \r\n\r\n✦✦✦✦✦✦ RETURNED PACKAGES: ✦✦✦✦✦✦\r\nPlease be sure to check your address for accuracy PRIOR to submitting your order.

International return package fees may be higher, depending on where you are located. We will then hold the package for a period of 7 days. If returned and unclaimed after 7 days the order will be forfeited, package destroyed and no refunds will be given. ",
"policy_refunds": "Since each item is made to order, like many of our products, we have a no return and no refund policy.  If there is damage during shipping, please alert us and contact the shipping carrier to file your claim.  If we have made an error on your barrel, please send a high quality photo to steve.barrels@customsentiments.com and be sure to reference your Etsy order number in the subject line, describing the issue.  We will review your order and if warranted, offer a free replacement.  We will then send a RMA label for the return of your defective barrel.  The return of the defective barrel is required prior to processing any free exchange.  Once received, we will send you a replacement.  All replacement&#39;s are for the same exact item only, with the same exact personalization, finish, etc. and no changes can be made to your order.\r\n\r\nORDER CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS:\r\nPlease contact us immediately if you need to make a change to your order.  We will do our best to accomodate, but we can in no way guarantee that a change can be made.  It is important to note that once an order is received, it is pre-labeled for shipping with a note regarding personalizations and sent down the production line through several stations.  It can take hours to locate where an order is in the process, which is why we cannot accept any change requests once an order enters the production queue.  Since each item is made to order, we do not allow cancellations.  Once an order has been placed, we will not honor cancellation requests, so please make sure you want to order our products prior to placing your order.Please be sure you are ordering exactly what you want and double check all personalization entered prior to placing an order.  In the event we agree to cancel an order, there is a $35 cancellation fee assessed and you will be refunded the price paid less the cancellation fee.  This is only allowed in rare circumstances and only if the order has not entered the production queue and is not something we do often.  There is absolutely no cancellations for any custom barrel designs (artwork) as we start the design process shortly after receiving the order or for orders that are in the production queue-no exceptions. By placing your order with us, you are agreeing to these terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the Holidays, all orders are pre-labeled as they enter the production queue to keep the queue clean, prevent duplicates from being shipped and to keep everything running efficiently. Once you place an order and your order is processed we will purchase a shipping label. When we purchase your label Etsy will automatically send you a shipping notification. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOUR ORDER SHIPPED, ONLY THAT WE PURCHASED A LABEL AND YOUR ORDER IS IN THE PRODUCTION QUEUE. Your tracking link provided will not become active until your order has been completed and picked up by the carrier. During the Holiday season we have to stick with a no change and no cancellation policy once an order has been pre-labeled and we will not make any exceptions, as this helps prevent any delays, duplicates or confusion with orders. Please be sure to check your order for accuracy prior to submitting, as we will not be able to make changes to your shipping address, your personalization, cancel an order or make any additional changes once your order has been pre-labeled and enters the production queue. \r\n\r\nPricing is subject to change without notice. We on occasion offer sales, free shipping offers, coupon codes and freebies. As with any website, a sale can be here today and gone tomorrow. If you place an order today and a sale starts tomorrow, this does not constitute a refund, just as if you were placing an order today and the price went up tomorrow we would not expect the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease note that in very rare circumstances (usually around Christmas), we may, at our discretion, substitute for a different hoop color if the wait time for the color you ordered exceeds one week.  This is very rare, but can happen and is something that every barrel company has to deal with from time to time and therefore, this will not warrant a refund or replacement as this cannot be helped. \r\n\r\nPROBLEMS WITH YOUR ORDER?\r\nPlease email order support at support@customsentiments.com, being sure to reference your Etsy Order number in the subject line of the email. A few good quality photos are required to open an exchange request. Due to the custom nature of our products, we do not offer refunds since once personalized it cannot simply be returned to stock. Please note that since wood is a natural product and not man made, there will be variations in color of wood from barrel to barrel and it may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos.  This is something that cannot be controlled for any wood product, not just barrels. Barrels are engraved using a laser and are not printed.  All true barrels will have a rivet from manufacturing- some more prominent than others no matter where ordered.   We just like to be more up front than most so you know what to expect.  Also note that the barrel rings may have a few &quot;scars&quot;, which is again perfectly normal no matter where you order a true barrel from.  The mentioned do not warrant an exchange.  Just enjoy your unique one of a kind barrel for the unique work of art it truly is and it&#39;ll love you back ;)  \r\n\r\nABANDONED ORDERS: We cannot process an order that is incomplete, not correctly entered or where additional shipping may be due due to request for upgrades in which your order will be on hold until payment has been received for the upgrade.  In the event we have questions regarding your order we will attempt to make contact with you.  If we have made reasonable effort to contact you regarding your order and we have not received a response within 60 days we will, at our discretion, treat your order as an abandoned order.  No refunds will be given and no cancellation requests accepted after 60 days from date of your order.  Since all orders need to be closed out within the Etsy system, a blank shipping notification will be sent out to close your order out after the initial 60 days wait time. \r\n\r\nNOTE: All information is given as an estimated time table and not a guaranteed date of service. We cannot be held liable for missing or incorrectly entered information or addresses entered by the customer, inclement weather or other service interruptions that cause missing, late or undelivered packages or other service interruptions that are out of our control. However, we are happy to assist and direct you the best we can should any shipping issue arise. Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be responsible for carrier delays due to inclement weather or other issues out of our control. No refunds will be given (even for rush services), when these issues arise as we cannot prevent them, nor control them. We are not responsible for a package once it is in the carriers hands and it is up to the carrier to deliver the package once shipped. Please contact the carrier for any shipping related issues- a tracking number is provided on all orders for your convenience. We are happy to assist you in contacting the carrier when needed to resolve delivery issues within 7 days of delivery date.",

Business days are considered M-F between business hours.  \r\n\r\nWe are closed on all major Holidays and Holiday weekends to allow for us to observe these Holidays with our families.  Although we may be able to answer questions and phone calls on occasion during these times, our stores are not open and we are not in production on the following dates (unless notated):\r\n\r\nNew Years: Dec 31st- January 1st\r\nValentine&#39;s Day: February 13th- February 16th \r\nEaster weekend: April 3rd- April 6th (Good Friday- Easter Monday)\r\nMother&#39;s Day: closed over weekend as usual\r\nFather&#39;s Day: closed over weekend as usual\r\nIndependence Day: July 3rd-6th\r\nLabor Day: Sept. 7th\r\nHalloween: closed over weekend as usual\r\nThanksgiving: November 25th-27th\r\nChristmas Eve and Christmas Day: Closed 12/23-12/29 for Christmas Break.

For certain Holidays, Etsy does not seem to automatically account for Holiday closings and may cause a miscalculation in your shipping time frame around these Holidays.  We are unable to change this and unfortunately cannot help this from happening as it is an issue in the Etsy system itself.  If your order shows it will ship on one of the above dates that we are closed, it will be shipped on the next business day.  If your order is placed outside of business hours or on a weekend or Holiday, it will be entered the next business day.

We offer larger sizes as well, but they cannot be customized due to their size. \r\nBARREL DIMENSIONS:\r\n1 Liter   6.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches\r\n2 Liter   7.5 x 5 x 5 inches\r\n3 Liter   8.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 inches\r\n5 Liter   9.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 inches\r\n10 Liter  12 x 8 x 8 inches\r\n20 Liter   15 x 10.5 x 10.5 inches\r\n*DIMESIONS ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE STAND HEIGHT AND WIDTH. If needing to fit within a specific space, please contact us and we can provide measurements including the stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: What&#39;s the difference between the finish and hoop color options? ANSWER: \r\nSteel Hoops are made of steel.\r\nBlack hoops are powder coated steel hoops.\r\nFinished will have a few light sprays of clear coat on it.\r\nUnfinished is simply unfinished- no clear coat\r\n✪No heavy stains, dyes or varnishes are used on these barrels so it will not affect the integrity of the barrel. Finished vs. unfinished is purely an aesthetics preference. Please note that since wood is a natural product it may be lighter or darker than depicted in photos.  Photos are of an actual barrel with designs superimposed onto the barrel. Barrels ate not printed, they are engraved using a laser burner.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How are these made?\r\nANSWER: These are made using a laser burner, as most custom distillery grade barrels are.  It is completely normal to have darker areas around the engraved portion of your barrel caused by the laser.  This is not smudging and is meant to give your barrel it&#39;s character. Some barrels will have more than others, but that is what makes each barrel unique and no two barrels alike.  Please love and respect your custom barrels for the unique pieces of art they are and they will love you back ;)  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: What are the barrels made from?\r\nANSWER: Our barrels are made from premium quality American White Oak. The staves are air dried for two years and all barrels have a medium char.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I cure the barrel?\r\nANSWER: Barrels should be cured prior to use. Start by filling the barrel with boiling or hot water and leave it to soak for 3 to 5 days. This allows the barrel to swell tightly against the hoops and ensure that the barrel doesn&#39;t leak.  Your barrel WILL leak if you have not cured it.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Are glues or nails used to make the barrel?\r\nANSWER: No, our barrels are all hand crafted with no use of glues or nails.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How should the barrel be stored?\r\nANSWER: Barrels are best stored in a cool damp environment such as a wine cellar. This will keep the exterior from drying out and minimize evaporation (Angels Share).  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: How many times can I use my barrel?\r\nANSWER: These are high grade barrels!  With proper care, you can use your barrel for 8 to 10 years. Following the cleaning and re-charing instructions will insure a long life for your product and be sure to not let your barrel dry out.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: I left my barrel dry for an extented time. Now it leaks... what do I do?\r\nANSWER: In many cases just re-cure the barrel. If it continues leaking, submerge the barrel in water for a couple of days. After it&#39;s been submerged, dry the exterior with a towel and fill it with water to see if it continues to leak. If so, find the leak and apply barrel wax to the hole... If you can&#39;t stop the leaking... cut in half and use as a planter!\r\n\r\nQUESTION: My barrel is rough around the edges and does not look exactly like pictured.  Is this a defect?  \r\nANSWER: No, these are made with natural wood and therefore there will always be variation in color, roughness, veining, etc.  This does not affect the functionality of your barrel and is not a defect.  This is something that every barrel company has to deal with and cannot be helped regardless of where you order from.  We just like to be more upfront about it.  In the barrel world, the uniqueness of each barrel is also what we consider it&#39;s character.  Although similar, no two barrels will ever be alike and that is what gives the barrels their character and what lends to the beauty and uniqueness of each barrel.  We suggest loving your barrel for the truly unique piece of art and it will love you back ;)\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ CLEANING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How often do I clean my barrel?\r\nANSWER: When aging hard spirits such as whiskey, rum or tequila, clean the barrel after two or three batches (or every 1 to 2 years). For wine, cider, liquor or other low alcohol content spirits, clean after each batch.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I clean  my barrel?\r\nMULTI- STEP ANSWER:\r\n1.Dissolve the Cleaning Solution into warm water (we sell a cleaning kit for this). Fill the barrel with this cleaning solution and soak for 24 hours. Empty and rinse 3 times with hot water.\r\n2.Dissolve the Neutralizing Acid into warm water. Fill the barrel with this neutralizing solution and soak for 15 minutes. Empty and rinse the barrel 3 times with hot water.\r\n3.To re-char the barrel interior, drain the barrel for 3 hours. Place a butane torch in the bung and spigot hole and re-char the inside.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: To prevent the barrel from drying out and minimize the possibility of contamination, barrels should always be stored full with spirits or water with sterilizing solution.\r\n\r\n***See cleaning package directions for exact mixture quantities.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ STORING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I store my barrel?\r\nANSWER: When storing the barrel fill the barrel with a mixture of sterilizing tablets and cool water. Fill the barrel with the solution and leave in a cool damp place until you are ready to use again.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ AGING FAQ&#39;S ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How long do I age my spirits?\r\nANSWER: There&#39;s no formula for the perfect time to age your spirits. Age to taste! We suggest you taste your spirits every week and once aged to YOUR taste, start drinking or move it to a glass bottle to stop the aging process.  \r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do smaller barrels age the spirit faster than large barrels?\r\nANSWER: Yes... due to the greater surface or contact area ratio, small size barrels will age 5 to 10 times faster then your standard 55 gallon barrel. These means that one month in a small barrel will produce the equivalent aging to 1 to 1 1/2 years in a full size barrel.\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************************\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪ BOOTLEGGIN&#39; ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\n***********************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nQUESTION: How do I get Whiskey from a bottle of Vodka, Swish or Moonshine?\r\nANSWER: When alcohol is distilled, either from potatoes, corn, fruit, grain or sugar cane, it produces Ethanol. A clear and tasteless alcohol. Distilleries then flavor and filter the alcohol to get their unique flavor. Vodka is the only alcohol you can buy in an unflavored form. When mixed with a bottle of  Barrel Premium Essence, you can recreate the taste of many of the famous brands.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Will a more expensive Vodka produce a better tasting whiskey?\r\nANSWER: No!  We actually recommend using a cheaper Vodka such as Taaka or the like, as it will pick up the flavors better and thus have a better taste.\r\n\r\nQUESTION: Do you sell Bootleg kits?  \r\nANSWER: Yes, we do!  Simply contact us and we would be happy to assist you.\r\n",

CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday.

"policy_additional": "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  \r\nImportant Notes:\r\n\r\n*Expedited orders, large orders or orders with not stock in the USA will come from our Hong Kong shop. We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave / print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order. We may request a visual photo of the sample for a final reference.   \r\n",
